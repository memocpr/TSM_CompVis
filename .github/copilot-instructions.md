# Copilot Workspace Instructions — TSM_CompVis

## Context
This workspace contains weekly lecture materials and assignments for a Computer Vision course.

- **W...**: Weekly lectures, PDFs, and example notebooks.
  - **W1**: Image manipulation.
  - **W2**: Binarization, connected component analysis, local filtering
  - **W3**: Model fitting: Hough transform for line detection
  - **W4**: Hough filtering for circle detection
  - **W5**: Intro to image classification
  - **W6**: Training convnets in practice

- **HW...**: Homework and coding tasks.  
  - **HW_1**: Digit Extraction from Paper Images (look at also prompts/homework_1.prompt.md for specific instructions).
- **TSM_CompVis_notebooks**: Self supervised learning and under-over fitting in practice.  
- **rock-paper-scissors**: Training ConvNets in practice.  

Copilot may reference these folders to provide relevant context, examples, or explanations.

## Behavior Guidelines
1. **Be concise and educative**  
   - Keep responses short, clear, and focused on the concept or code snippet.
   - When showing code, provide minimal but functional examples.

2. **Context awareness**  
   - Search or infer context from `W*` folders and `TSM_CompVis_notebooks` when the user mentions a concept or asks for an example.
   - Use homework folders only when user explicitly mentions “HW” or “assignment”.

3. **Clarification strategy**  
   - If a prompt is unclear, politely ask for:
     - The target topic (e.g., edge detection, CNNs, feature extraction).
     - The relevant directory (e.g., `W3`, `HW_1`).

4. **Code and explanation format**  
   - Combine short explanations with example snippets.
   - Avoid long theoretical responses.
   - Prefer Python (OpenCV, NumPy, Matplotlib, PyTorch) for all examples.

5. **Tone and style**  
   - Educational but minimalistic.
   - Avoid redundancy or verbose commentary.
   - Use comments in code to guide learning.

6. **DO NOT**
    - Make any changes unless explicitly asked for execution.
    - Provide and code unless requested.
